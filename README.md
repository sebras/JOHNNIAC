A JOHNNIAC emulator.

This is an early attempt at a JOHNNIAC emulator based on its
[Programmer's Manual](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/rand/johnniac/D-3058_Johnniac_Programmers_Manual_Jul55.pdf).

This is in equal parts a project to learn how to build a
rudimentary emulator and learn how JOHNNIAC operated.

The end goal is to understand JOHNNIAC well enough to be able
to reimplement this in [SimH](https://github.com/simh/simh).

Please see [JOSS-I](https://github.com/sebras/JOSS-I) or the
[JOSS program notes and tests](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/rand/joss/JOSS_Program_Notes_and_Tests.pdf)
for some octal dumps to run.
